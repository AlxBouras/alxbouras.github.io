This resource provides a freshwater supply to nearly 1.4 billion people, making it a particularly vulnerable region to climate change. HMA includes the highest mountain ranges on Earth, including the Himalayas, Karakoram, and Hindu Kush, which surround the Tibetan Plateau (TP), an area of nearly 2.5\u0026nbsp;million\u0026nbsp;km² with an average elevation of about 4000\u0026nbsp;m.\nStudying climate change in HMA is challenging because of its complex topography which makes difficult the application of climate models in this area, and limits the possibility to collect observations. The aim of this thesis is to study the variability and trends of the climate in HMA. It is based on two main objectives: (1) studying and quantifying the climate change in HMA with general circulation models (GCMs) experiments and observation datasets, and (2) improving the simulated snow cover in mountainous regions in GCMs.\nCurrent GCMs simulate a cold bias in HMA reaching an annual average value of -1.9 °C, associated with an overestimation of snow cover of 12\u0026nbsp;% and an excess of precipitation of 1.5\u0026nbsp;mm\u0026nbsp;d$^{-1}$ (relative biases of 52\u0026nbsp;% and 143\u0026nbsp;% as compared to observations). Model biases and their ability to simulate trends do not show a clear link, suggesting that model bias is not a robust criterion to discard models in trend analysis.\nThe simulated median warming in HMA over 2081-2100 as compared to 1995-2014 reaches respectively 1.9 and 6.5\u0026nbsp;°C on the low (SSP1-2.6) and the high (SSP5-8.5) greenhouse gas emission scenarios. This warming is associated with a relative decrease in the snow cover extent of -9.4 to -32.2\u0026nbsp;% and a relative increase in precipitation of 8.5 to 24.9\u0026nbsp;% in these two respective scenarios. The warming is 11\u0026nbsp;% higher over HMA than over the other Northern Hemisphere continental surfaces, excluding the Arctic area.\n5 parameterizations of the snow cover fraction (SCF) are tested, calibrated, and validated using a snow reanalysis in HMA. The relationship between SCF and snow depth (SD) differs strongly between flat and mountainous areas, leading to an overestimation of SCF in parameterizations that do not take into account the sub-grid topography. The SCF changes with respect to SD follow a hysteresis, with a rapid increase in SCF during the accumulation phase and a slower patchy retreat during ablation periods, discarding parameterizations that do not consider this effect.\nThe use of a new SCF parameterization adapted to mountain areas in LMDZ/ORCHIDEE reduces the simulated SCF bias over mountainous regions by 5 to 10\u0026nbsp;% in winter, reducing the mean annual cold bias in HMA from -1.8\u0026nbsp;°C to around -1\u0026nbsp;°C. However, this added value is sometimes masked by other model biases. Additional datasets covering other regions should be considered to allow an optimal tuning of the SCF parameterizations.\nThe lack of snowpack observations in mountainous regions is currently a major limitation to set up realistic SCF parameterizations. Improving SCF parameterizations is one of the important developments that need to be considered when developing the sub-grid parameterizations, which are required to improve the GCMs over mountainous areas.

Indeed, snow has generally a much higher albedo compared to other surfaces and therefore reduces the amount of solar radiation absorbed by the surface. General circulation models (GCMs) usually compute the snow-cover fraction (SCF) as a diagnostic variable derived from other snow quantities, as for instance, the snow water equivalent (SWE) or the snow depth (SD). The relationship between SWE and SCF varies from simple linear relationships to more advanced parameterizations taking into account further parameters, such as snow density, ground roughness lengths, etc. However, only a few GCMs take into account the topography, while Swenson and Lawrence (2012) highlighted strong differences in snow-cover extent between plains and mountainous areas, which may be explained by the persistence of snow on the summits whereas a faster melting occurs in the valleys. In this study, we designed three new snow parameterizations that include the impact of the sub-grid topography on the SCF in the ORCHIDEE land surface model (LSM) coupled to the LMDZ atmospheric model (part of the French GCM of IPSL). This model shows a strong cold bias and an excess of SCF over the High Mountains of Asia (HMA). The new SCF parameterizations are based on the following existing ones: Swenson and Lawrence (2012; hereafter SL12), Roesch et al. (2001; hereafter R01), and a modified version of Niu and Yang (2007; hereafter NY07). These new parameterizations were calibrated over HMA using a high-resolution snow reanalysis, and compared to a deep learning model trained on the reanalysis dataset. The calibrated parameterizations SL12, R01, and the modified version of NY07 were then tested in coupled ORCHIDEE/LMDZ simulations. Preliminary results show improvements in simulated snow cover in HMA but slight deterioration in other areas depending on the model resolution. They suggest also that calibration should be extended to other snow-covered areas and should include other parameters such as the type of vegetation in particular.

Climate studies over HMA are related to serious challenges concerning the exposure of human infrastructures to natural hazards and the water resources for agriculture, drinking water and hydroelectricity to whom several hundred million inhabitants are depending. However, temperature, precipitation, and snow cover in this region are poorly described in global climate models because their coarse resolution is not adapted to the complex topography of this area. Since the first CMIP exercises, a cold model bias has been identified in HMA, however, its attribution is not obvious and may be different from one model to another. Our study focuses on a multi-model comparison of 27 CMIP6 models over 1979-2014. A cold bias is still present in near-surface air temperature over HMA reaching an annual value of -2.0 °C (± 3.2 °C), associated with an over-extended relative snow cover extent of 53 % (± 62 %), and a relative excess of precipitation of 139 % (± 38 %). Precipitation biases are uncertain because of the undercatch of solid precipitation in observations. Higher-resolution models do not systematically perform better than the coarse-gridded ones, suggesting that the development of more realistic physical parameterizations over complex topography areas is still needed. We implemented new snow cover parameterizations taking into account the sub-grid topography in the IPSL general circulation model. This model shows a strong cold bias and an excess of snow cover over HMA. These new parameterizations were calibrated over HMA using a high-resolution snow reanalysis and compared to a deep learning algorithm. Preliminary results show improvements in simulated snow cover and reduced cold bias over HMA. The residual biases suggest that other factors must be involved (e.g., tropospheric cold bias, precipitation biases, aerosol forcing uncertainties, orographic drag), and raise the potential limitation of the implemented parameterizations over permanent snow areas. Nevertheless, taking into account the sub-grid topography in the snow cover parameterization is essential to properly represent snow cover dynamics over mountainous areas.

Similarly to previous CMIP models, this new generation of general circulation models (GCMs) shows a mean cold bias over this area reaching −1.9 [−8.2 to 2.9] °C (90 % confidence interval) in comparison with the Climate Research Unit (CRU) observational dataset, associated with a snow cover mean overestimation of 12 % [−13 % to 43 %], corresponding to a relative bias of 52 % [−53 % to 183 %] in comparison with the NOAA Climate Data Record (CDR) satellite dataset. The temperature and snow cover model biases are more pronounced in winter. Simulated precipitation rates are overestimated by 1.5 [0.3 to 2.9] mm d−1, corresponding to a relative bias of 143 % [31 % to 281 %], but this might be an apparent bias caused by the undercatch of solid precipitation in the APHRODITE (Asian Precipitation-Highly-Resolved Observational Data Integration Towards Evaluation of Water Resources) observational reference. For most models, the cold surface bias is associated with an overestimation of snow cover extent, but this relationship does not hold for all models, suggesting that the processes of the origin of the biases can differ from one model to another. A significant correlation between snow cover bias and surface elevation is found, and to a lesser extent between temperature bias and surface elevation, highlighting the model weaknesses at high elevation. The models with the best performance for temperature are not necessarily the most skillful for the other variables, and there is no clear relationship between model resolution and model skill. This highlights the need for a better understanding of the physical processes driving the climate in this complex topographic area, as well as for further parameterization developments adapted to such areas. A dependency of the simulated past trends on the model biases is found for some variables and seasons; however, some highly biased models fall within the range of observed trends, suggesting that model bias is not a robust criterion to discard models in trend analysis. The HMA median warming simulated over 2081–2100 with respect to 1995–2014 ranges from 1.9 [1.2 to 2.7] °C for SSP1-2.6 to 6.5 [4.9 to 9.0] °C for SSP5-8.5. This general warming is associated with a relative median snow cover extent decrease from −9.4 % [−16.4 % to −5.0 %] to −32.2 % [−49.1 % to −25.0 %] and a relative median precipitation increase from 8.5 % [4.8 % to 18.2 %] to 24.9 % [14.4 % to 48.1 %] by the end of the century in these respective scenarios. The warming is 11 % higher over HMA than over the other Northern Hemisphere continental surfaces, excluding the Arctic area. Seasonal temperature, snow cover and precipitation changes over HMA show a linear relationship with the global surface air temperature (GSAT), except for summer snow cover which shows a slower decrease at strong levels of GSAT.","tags":["High Mountain Asia","CMIP6","Temperature","Precipitation","Snow"],"title":"Climate change in the High Mountain Asia in CMIP6","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexandre Bouras"],"categories":["Science et Climat"],"content":"Où en est-on du #réchauffementclimatique 🌡 ?

If however their method does not suit your needs and you want to install your own environment, here is the method I use (it works from a Linux workstation, you have to adapt if you are under another OS). This method is not official, nor generic, if you have other tips/methods don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to share them in the comments below.\n1. Connect to your server ssh -XY -o ServerAliveInterval=60 login@server  Think to add the options -XY otherwise you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to open Jupyter Notebooks in your browser. ServerAliveInterval=60 is optional, but it allows you not to get disconnected if you don\u0026rsquo;t have any activity for a while (it depends on servers).\n You can directly make an alias in your bashrc, so you only have to type the alias in your terminal.   For example:\ngvim ~/.bashrc # And add this line at the end or in an alias section if you already have one alias server='ssh -XY -o ServerAliveInterval=60 login@server'  2. Install Miniconda In general, there is not infinite space on the servers and therefore I advise you to install the minimalist version of Anaconda : Miniconda, in order to install only what you need.\nSo first of all, I download Miniconda on the server and install it:\nwget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh sh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh   During the installation, be careful to change the installation path to avoid installing it in your home, otherwise, it may saturate your space very quickly! In general, it is recommended to install it in a data space or another where you have more storage space.\n[/home/login/miniconda3] \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; /data/login/miniconda3\n  At the end of the installation, I recommend that you initialize conda so that it automatically adds the correct path to your bashrc so that you can directly have the conda command available (if you prefer to put these lines somewhere else, you can adapt them).\nDo you wish the installer to initialize Miniconda3 by running conda init? [yes|no] [no] \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; yes  Then update your bashrc:\nsource ~/.bashrc  You should have a (base) that should appear in front of your command line.\n If you are not happy, fucked up any step or you are scared\u0026hellip; that happens\u0026hellip; Just remove the folder miniconda3 (rm -r /data/login/miniconda3 or the path you put at the installation step) and then remove the lines that were added in your bashrc. Then you can start over or forget about Miniconda forever :p   3. Add conda-forge and update your installation (optional but I recommend) This step is completely optional, but it allows to facilitate the installation of future packages that would not be the basic channel of conda.\nconda config --add channels conda-forge conda config --set channel_priority strict conda update -n base -c defaults conda  If you want to know more, click on the link in the title.\n4. Create an environment I do not recommend that you use your base environment. By experience, it happened to me several times to break this environment without being able to go back and to have to finally reinstall everything. The problem is that when you are not familiar with the environment you don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily make a backup and it is sometimes difficult to get back to something functional!\nSo here is how I work on my side, I create an environment with the name of my project and a version (for example project_v0):\nconda create -n project_v0 conda activate project_v0  Then install all the packages you need, especially jupyter (+ jupyterlab if you prefer from basic notebooks, which is my case).\nI also recommend you to install the nb_conda_kernels package in each of your environments, which will allow you to switch from one environment to another, directly from your notebooks.\nconda install nb_conda_kernels   Here is an example of an environment I created for my Ph.D.: https://github.com/alxbouras/PhD/tree/master/envs/phd   To save and manage your environment, see at the end of this tutorial.\nFor simplicity, I also recommend that you add the line conda activate project_v0 to your bashrc so you don\u0026rsquo;t have to activate it every time. This should replace the (base) with the name of your environment.\n5. Configure Jupyter The problem with launching Jupyter on a server is that you will have to make an ssh bridge between your machine and the server to open Jupyter directly on your internet browser. So you have to specify to Jupyter not to open a window on the server and to open Jupyter on a specific port (if needed).\nThere are two ways to do this, either you specify all this in your command when you run Jupyter, or you create a configuration file:\nCommand line Here is an example of a command line (where XXXX would be your port number), but don\u0026rsquo;t run it yet, it would be for later!\njupyter lab --port XXXX --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser  Configuration file Alternatively, you can put this directly into a configuration file and just run the command jupyter lab (or jupyter notebook):\n# Create a configuration file and edit it jupyter notebook --generate-config gvim ~/.jupyter/jupyter_notebook_config.py # Uncomment these lines and modify them as follow c.NotebookApp.allow_origin = '*' c.NotebookApp.ip = '0.0.0.0' c.NotebookApp.port = XXXX c.NotebookApp.open_browser = False  More informations:\n https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/public_server.html https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42848130/why-i-cant-access-remote-jupyter-notebook-server  Report errors (optionnal) Optionally you can also send automatically report to Anaconda in case of errors:\nconda config --set report_errors true  6. Launch a job This step depends on the server you are on, so find out how to launch an interactive job. Depending on the servers and their security level, it can be more or less complicated (even more so during teleworking if you use intermediate machines!).\nThink of adapting the memory you need, because very often jobs are killed if you exceed it.\n7. Run Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab Once your job is launched you can now directly run jupyter lab or jupyter notebook if you configured Jupyter (see above) otherwise:\njupyter lab --port XXXX --ip 0.0.0.0 --no-browser  Then you need to make a tunnel from your own terminal (on your PC, not the server), which is usually a command as:\nssh -L XXXX:hostname:XXXX login@server  with possible other flags as -fNL (but I\u0026rsquo;m not familiar with that, so go and look what you need, ex: https://explainshell.com/explain?cmd=ssh+-L+-N+-f+-l)\nThen you can open the link directly given from Jupyter on the server, which will open on your browser.\nHere is an example of a script, to get automatically the ssh tunnel from one of the servers I use and run jupyter lab (you can inspire yourself from that and adapt it to your needs): jupyterlab.sh.\n8. Save your environment Once you have something functional and stable enough. I advise you to save your environment and not to touch it anymore (not even to update it). If you want to update it or install new packages (which would cause version changes in your other packages), in that case I advise you to clone your current environment and do some tests then if you get something stable again, call it with the same project name and increment the version number by making a new backup. This way you can always go back to an old environment and/or rebuild it identically (at least on the machine you were on).\nTo save your environment here are the different methods I use:\nconda list --explicit \u0026gt; projet_v0.txt conda env export \u0026gt; projet_v0.yml conda env export --from-history \u0026gt; projet_v0_fh.yml  The first one allows you to have the exact version of packages on the machine you are using and their dependencies, which will allow you to have exactly the same environment (however it might not work on some other machines). The second one is similar to the first one but with the yaml format. The last one allows you to only have the names of the packages you installed with their version number if specified (what I advise you to add otherwise it might not work in the future). This last one allows sharing your environment across different platforms/OS, but without a guaranty that it will work (knowing that some packages are not always available across all platforms) and even on your own machine/server if you didn\u0026rsquo;t specify all version numbers, it\u0026rsquo;s possible that you won\u0026rsquo;t succeed to make it work in the future. Hence I recommend saving your environment under different format/version.\nTo get more information, go and check the conda documentation: https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html\nI also recommend you to document your environment with a README, so you know how you set it up, what\u0026rsquo;s inside, etc., here is an example from my environment: https://github.com/alxbouras/PhD/tree/master/envs/phd.\nI hope this will help you! I\u0026rsquo;m not an expert with conda myself, but this is a sharing of the experience I\u0026rsquo;ve gained over the past few years. Feel free to ask questions in the comments and/or fill in any points that I haven\u0026rsquo;t explained well or that are missing!\n","date":1619078436,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672910257,"objectID":"b728a70d28ce6c5291a7bcf9fd8260f8","permalink":"https://alxbouras.github.io/post/tutorial/how-to-install-jupyter-notebook-on-a-server/","publishdate":"2021-04-22T10:00:36+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/tutorial/how-to-install-jupyter-notebook-on-a-server/","section":"post","summary":"First of all, I recommend you to look at what your server proposes as a method to launch Jupyter Notebooks.

This resource provides a freshwater supply to nearly 1.4 billion people, making it a particularly vulnerable region to climate change. HMA includes the highest mountain ranges on Earth, including the Himalayas, Karakoram, and Hindu Kush, which surround the Tibetan Plateau (TP), an area of nearly 2.5 million km² with an average elevation of about 4000 m.\nStudying climate change in HMA is challenging because of its complex topography which makes difficult the application of climate models in this area, and limits the possibility to collect observations. The aim of this thesis is to study the variability and trends of the climate in HMA. It is based on two main objectives: (1) studying and quantifying the climate change in HMA with general circulation models (GCMs) experiments and observation datasets, and (2) improving the simulated snow cover in mountainous regions in GCMs.\nCurrent GCMs simulate a cold bias in HMA reaching an annual average value of -1.9 °C, associated with an overestimation of snow cover of 12 % and an excess of precipitation of 1.5 mm d$^{-1}$ (relative biases of 52 % and 143 % as compared to observations). Model biases and their ability to simulate trends do not show a clear link, suggesting that model bias is not a robust criterion to discard models in trend analysis.\nThe simulated median warming in HMA over 2081-2100 as compared to 1995-2014 reaches respectively 1.9 and 6.5 °C on the low (SSP1-2.6) and the high (SSP5-8.5) greenhouse gas emission scenarios. This warming is associated with a relative decrease in the snow cover extent of -9.4 to -32.2 % and a relative increase in precipitation of 8.5 to 24.9 % in these two respective scenarios. The warming is 11 % higher over HMA than over the other Northern Hemisphere continental surfaces, excluding the Arctic area.\n5 parameterizations of the snow cover fraction (SCF) are tested, calibrated, and validated using a snow reanalysis in HMA. The relationship between SCF and snow depth (SD) differs strongly between flat and mountainous areas, leading to an overestimation of SCF in parameterizations that do not take into account the sub-grid topography. The SCF changes with respect to SD follow a hysteresis, with a rapid increase in SCF during the accumulation phase and a slower patchy retreat during ablation periods, discarding parameterizations that do not consider this effect.\nThe use of a new SCF parameterization adapted to mountain areas in LMDZ/ORCHIDEE reduces the simulated SCF bias over mountainous regions by 5 to 10 % in winter, reducing the mean annual cold bias in HMA from -1.8 °C to around -1 °C. However, this added value is sometimes masked by other model biases. Additional datasets covering other regions should be considered to allow an optimal tuning of the SCF parameterizations.\nThe lack of snowpack observations in mountainous regions is currently a major limitation to set up realistic SCF parameterizations. Improving SCF parameterizations is one of the important developments that need to be considered when developing the sub-grid parameterizations, which are required to improve the GCMs over mountainous areas.\n Keywords: High Mountain Asia, Mountain Areas, General Circulation Models, CMIP6, Snow Cover, Parameterizations\nSupervised by Martin Ménégoz and Gerhard Krinner.

Nevertheless, it can be used as a basis, but please refer to the Wowchemy documentation first. I updated all the links below to refer to their new websites.   I guess you are wondering how to make an academic website on your GitHub with the address .github.io. There are, of course, the solutions proposed directly by GitHub page, however, it looks a bit \u0026ldquo;old school\u0026rdquo; in my opinion. Another option is to make the site by yourself in markdown, but it seemed quite long and tedious. I finally came across Wowchemy1 for Hugo2 that suits my needs and is the purpose of this tutorial! Feel free to leave a comment if you have any questions and/or additional information.\n You need to be a bit familiar with the basics of GitHub, but you don\u0026rsquo;t need any knowledge of html/css.   1. Make a GitHub page You can directly follow the instructions on their page: https://pages.github.com/.\n The important is to create the repository your-name.github.io, then we will update the content of this repository automatically with a Wowchemy Academic template.\n2. Install Academic Theme and Hugo Again you\u0026rsquo;ll find the steps on their website: https://wowchemy.com/docs/hugo-tutorials/deployment/#github-pages\n There are different ways to install the Academic theme. The recommended installation will automatically deploy it on a free server, and I didn\u0026rsquo;t find a way to link it to the GitHub page later, so I recommend following the Git installation from the link above.   Install Hugo I had some trouble with installing Hugo with Homebrew on Linux. If you do have the same problem, I advise you to try to install it with the snap version (don\u0026rsquo;t install it with apt-get because the version is not updated: see this issue). All this Academic theme is based on the Hugo Framework so it is necessary to install it.\nFork the Academic Kickstart repository  The new repository name is: wowchemy/starter-hugo-academic, so replace academic-kickstart by starter-hugo-academic in the following paragraph.     It will automatically create a new repository academic-kickstart in your GitHub account. This repository will allow you to manage your website, and then to publish it into the previously create repository your-name.github.io. Finally, you just need to clone and initialize the theme on your computer:\ngit clone https://github.com/your-name/academic-kickstart.git cd academic-kickstart git submodule update --init --recursive  3. Deploy your website on your GitHub page We need now to add your-name.github.io repository as a submodule inside the public folder of the academic-kickstart repository as explained in this documentation.\n The method bellow seems outdated, so follow the link above.   git submodule add -f -b master https://github.com/your-name/your-name.github.io.git public  Then you need to generate the website with the hugo command. First, you can commit and push your changes from the academic-kickstart repository on GitHub and then do the same for the your-name.github.io submodule and your website will be available online!\ngit add . git commit -m \u0026quot;Initial commit\u0026quot; git push -u origin master hugo # Generate the website inside the public directory cd public git add . git commit -m \u0026quot;Build website\u0026quot; git push origin master cd ..  You can easily make this automatic with a bash script for the future, for example: update.sh, and then you only have to write: sh update.sh your_commit_message.\n4. Update your content and customize your page You can then follow the documentation  Getting Started With the Page Builder and  Customization, where you\u0026rsquo;ll find all the information! Before to start updating, launch the hugo server from your local academic-kickstart folder with the command:\nhugo server  you will be able to have an instant preview in your browser before uploading it to GitHub. If you don\u0026rsquo;t know any editing software, I can advise you Atom in combination with typora which is convenient for directly editing the content with markdown.\n  Source Themes Academic 4.8.0 \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Hugo Static Site Generator v0.70.0/extended linux/amd64 BuildDate: 2020-05-13T17:30:34Z \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1589881138,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672910257,"objectID":"4e7207fc5fc53a1d7243a0e4b933c502","permalink":"https://alxbouras.github.io/post/tutorial/how-to-create-an-academic-github-page-with-hugo/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T11:38:58+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/tutorial/how-to-create-an-academic-github-page-with-hugo/","section":"post","summary":" ","tags":["Website","GitHub"],"title":"How to Create an Academic/Wowchemy GitHub Page With Hugo?","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1589527800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672910257,"objectID":"61ac81bc8cf49365e8e17e4e33a73808","permalink":"https://alxbouras.github.io/talk/phd/lmdz/lmdz-pour-letude-du-climat-regional/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T18:28:51+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/phd/lmdz/lmdz-pour-letude-du-climat-regional/","section":"talk","summary":"LMDZ for regional climate study : “cold bias” in High Mountain Asia (HMA)","tags":["LMDZ","High Mountain Asia"],"title":"LMDZ for Regional Climate Studies","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Alexandre Bouras"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1578900600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672910257,"objectID":"57c06a72efdc34f7072d1f14392d225d","permalink":"https://alxbouras.github.io/talk/phd/lmdz/pedalons/20200113_zoom/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T17:48:38+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/phd/lmdz/pedalons/20200113_zoom/","section":"talk","summary":"Modélisation de la variabilité et des tendances climatiques en Himalaya pour une meilleure compréhension de leurs impacts sur la cryosphère","tags":["LMDZ","High Mountain Asia"],"title":"PEDALONS: Zoom and Regional Climates","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Redouane Lguensat","Alexandre Bouras","Sally Close","Thierry Penduff"],"categories":null,"content":"The variability of sea-level anomalies (SLA) observed by satellite altimeters combines two components: a forced component paced by the atmospheric variability, and an intrinsic and chaotic component emerging from the ocean itself.This work presents a deep convolutional neural network (ConvNet) trained to estimate the forced variability from SLA observations. The ConvNet is trained on the available OCCIPUT 50-member ensemble of global oceanic hindcasts. The use of global SLA fields to train the ConvNet being computationally impossible, representative regions of the ocean dynamics were carefully selected to allow training the ConvNet in an acceptable time.The algorithm yields an estimation of the forced model variability with a 2~cm RMS error and a temporal correlation of 0.9. We compare this performance to that of a bandpass filter proposed recently, and show that our ConvNet has the advantage to adapt its cutoff scales locally and identify larger-scale intrinsic patterns.The algorithm is applied to global altimetric observations, and shown to significantly increase the variance of winter SLA explained by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index.\nhttps://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019AGUFMGC31L1373L/abstract\n","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672928763,"objectID":"d9a88e9c3d0793b440dfea7d480dfb96","permalink":"https://alxbouras.github.io/talk/master/agu/","publishdate":"2023-01-05T12:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/talk/master/agu/","section":"talk","summary":"The variability of sea-level anomalies (SLA) observed by satellite altimeters combines two components: a forced component paced by the atmospheric variability, and an intrinsic and chaotic component emerging from the ocean itself.","tags":["AGU","Deep Learning","Ocean"],"title":"AGU2019: Convolutional Neural Networks for Estimating Atmospherically-forced Sea Level Variations","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Alexandre Bouras"],"categories":null,"content":"Quick presentation of my PhD\n","date":1574233200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1672910257,"objectID":"d3718613e1659e675170050fcee7291e","permalink":"https://alxbouras.github.io/talk/phd/journee-des-theses/2019/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T18:25:37+02:00","relpermalink":"/talk/phd/journee-des-theses/2019/","section":"talk","summary":"Quick presentation of my PhD","tags":["High Mountain Asia","LMDZ","CMIP6","Snow"],"title":"Journée des Thèses 2019","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Thierry Penduff","Alexandre Bouras","Redouane Lguensat","Sally Close","Sabrina Speich"],"categories":null,"content":"The variability of sea-level anomalies (SLA) observed by satellite altimeters combines two components: a forced component paced by the atmospheric variability, and an intrinsic and chaotic component emerging from the ocean itself. This paper presents a Machine Learning algorithm, trained on ensemble simulation outputs, to estimate the forced variability from SLA observations. Our algorithm estimates the forced model variability with a 2 cm RMS error and a temporal correlation of 0.9, a skill similar to that of a bandpass filter proposed recently, but with the additional ability to adapt its cutoff scales locally.
